## The problem

Most medical visits still start “cold”:

- Patients arrive with complex stories, fears, and goals—but have limited time to explain them.
- Clinicians often begin with fragmented information and spend the first minutes reconstructing basics.
- Clinics absorb the downstream cost: delays, repeat explanations, lower trust, and staff fatigue.

The result is a predictable pattern: **rushed visits, repeated intake, missed context, and eroded patient loyalty.**

---

## The solution

**Medcol is an AI-powered pre-visit layer** that prepares both sides before they meet.

### What Medcol does

1. **Patient pre-visit interview (web/mobile link, multilingual)**
    
    Patients share their story in natural language, at their own pace—symptoms, timeline, meds, history, concerns, and goals. They can upload relevant documents.
    
2. **Clinician intent (optional, lightweight)**
    
    Clinicians can set visit context such as the visit purpose, must-not-miss risks, or focus areas—so the summary is aligned with how the visit will run.
    
3. **Clinician-ready pre-visit summary**
    
    Medcol synthesizes the intake into a structured view that is easy to scan:
    
- key complaint + timeline
- relevant history, meds, allergies
- patient priorities and concerns
- clarifying questions and “needs follow-up” items
    
    (Designed to support clinical workflow—not replace clinical judgment.)
    
1. **Operational readiness**
    
    Clinics can see who is “prepared” vs “not prepared,” send reminders, and reduce last-minute intake burden at reception.

## What Medcol is not

- **Not an EHR** — Medcol sits before the visit and integrates where possible.
- **Not a diagnostic engine** — it structures information and supports preparation; clinical decisions remain with licensed clinicians.
- **Not an advertising/data-selling business** — trust is central; data use is consent-driven and purpose-limited.

## Who benefits and how

### For patients

- Feel heard before the appointment starts
- Less anxiety and less repetition
- More time in the visit for real discussion and understanding

### For clinicians

- Start with context instead of blank charts
- Fewer “I forgot to ask…” moments
- Less cognitive load and less avoidable admin work

### For clinics

- Smoother flow on busy days (less front-desk chaos, fewer delays cascading)
- More consistent patient experience (trust, reviews, repeat visits)
- Better readiness for documentation quality and operational metrics

---

## Success definition

Medcol is successful when **a clinic can reliably start visits prepared**:

- Most patients arrive with a completed pre-visit story
- Clinicians consistently report the visit starts faster and feels more human
- Operations see fewer bottlenecks caused by intake and repeated questioning
- Trust increases: patients feel respected and choose to return

## Mission, vision, theory of change

**Vision**

**Every medical visit starts with understanding.**

**Mission**

💡

**We help clinics prepare each visit in advance by turning patient stories into clear, clinician-ready summaries—safely and seamlessly.**

</aside>

**Theory of Change**

<aside>
💡

**If clinics can capture the patient’s story before the appointment and deliver it as a structured summary to the clinician, then visits start faster, feel more human, and run more reliably.**

## How we prove value (what we measure)

Medcol is designed to be measurable in pilots and deployments.

**Primary metrics**

- Pre-visit completion rate (% of appointments with completed intake)
- Time impact (minutes saved in early visit / reduced overtime)
- Patient experience (“felt understood” score / short NPS)
- Clinician satisfaction (burnout signal proxy, perceived preparedness)

**Secondary metrics**

- No-show and reschedule rates
- Repeat visits for “same unresolved complaint” (where measurable)
- Intake/admin burden indicators (front-desk time, calls, form duplication)

---

## Go-to-market (how we sell)

**Hybrid: product-led wedge + sales-led expansion**

### Product-led (small & mid-size clinics)

- A doctor or small clinic starts with a self-serve trial
- They see summaries for real patients within days
- A champion emerges and brings the practice manager/owner into the decision

### Sales-led (hospital groups, telemedicine platforms, partners)

- Discovery → tailored demo → 6–8 week pilot with agreed KPIs → procurement
- Early delivery of a security/compliance pack to reduce veto risk

---

## Business model (simple and aligned with trust)

We monetize via clinic/partner payments—not ads, and not selling health data.

**Revenue streams**

1. **Seat-based subscription** — **$20/user/month** for clinicians (300 requests per seat monthly) via [app.medcol.io](http://app.medcol.io)
2. **Enterprise plan** — e.g., **$5,000/month** for large organizations (includes support + integration + 10 000 API calls included)
3. **API usage** — e.g., **$1 per API unit** for partners embedding Medcol (completed intake + clinician summary generated)

---

## Why Medcol (differentiation)

Medcol is purpose-built for one critical moment: **the preparation window before the visit**.

- It is **dual-sided** (patient story + clinician intent)
- It converts free-text into **usable clinical structure**, not raw transcripts
- It fits workflow and operations (prepared/not-prepared visibility, reminders)
- It treats **trust, privacy, and safety** as product requirements, not checkboxes

## What’s next (12-month focus)

- Ship a stable v1 for 1–3 specialties (e.g., primary care, pediatrics, OB/GYN)
- Run 5–10 serious pilots with measurable outcomes and 3–4 case studies
- Deliver security/compliance foundations + 2–3 integrations (booking/EHR/telemed)
- Expand multilingual support (e.g., English + Arabic + Russian)
